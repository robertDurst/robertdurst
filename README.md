## Me

Programming language enthusiast and aspiring compiler hacker. Currently working on [Caffeine](https://github.com/Brickell-Research/caffeine_lang) and [finding ways to contribute back](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ArobertDurst+org%3Agleam-lang) to the wonderful [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) community.

## Meetups

I was at one point the co-host for the largest developer only cryptocurrency meetup in the SF Bay Area (circa 2018). I had a lot of fun and am definitely hoping to get back to hosting meetups in the near future.
