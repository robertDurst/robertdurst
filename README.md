## Programming Languages 

While what I've learned from hacking around on programming languages comes up every now and then on the day-to-day at work, my exploration of programming languages is not yet my professional calling. However, as of late, I've started making a step in the right direction and have started some research with the University of Utah (moving to SLC summer 2023!).

### Cool PL Stuff I've Done this Far

* Created my own somewhat functional programming language: [Sailfish Programming Language](https://github.com/sailfish-lang/sailfishc)
* Contributed to [Nessie: Automatically Testing JavaScript APIs with
Asynchronous Callbacks](https://software-lab.org/publications/icse2022_Nessie.pdf) with the folks at [North Eastern](https://prl.khoury.northeastern.edu/).

## Blogging

I occasionally blog. Working on that first post of 2023...

My personal blog is on [my website, robdurst.com](https://robdurst.com/).

I've also blogged for work:
  * Spring Health - _cannot seem to find the link_
  * DocuSign: [My experience: Why defensive coding matters](https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/my-experience-why-defensive-coding-matters)
  
## Meetups

I was at one point the co-host for the largest developer only cryptocurrency meetup in the SF Bay Area (circa 2018). I had a lot of fun and am definitely hoping to get back to hosting meetups in the near future.
