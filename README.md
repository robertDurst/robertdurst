1️⃣ I’m building [Caffeine](https://caffeine-lang.run/) ☕: `a compiler that generates reliability artifacts from service expectation definitions.`

2️⃣ I'm working to contribute back to the wonderful [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) community: [my PRs](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ArobertDurst+org%3Agleam-lang).

3️⃣ Professionally I am a `Site Reliability Engineer` @ [Spring Health](https://www.springhealth.com/).

4️⃣ On the side I am a Compiler Researcher @ [Brickell Research](https://brickellresearch.org/).

5️⃣ I also speak:
